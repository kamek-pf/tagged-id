error[E0382]: use of moved value: `id1`
  --> tests/fail/not_take_twice.rs:14:16
   |
11 |     let id1: Id<TestStruct> = "oops".into();
   |         --- move occurs because `id1` has type `Id<TestStruct>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
12 |     let id2 = id1.take();
   |                   ------ `id1` moved due to this method call
13 |
14 |     assert_eq!(id1.take(), id2);
   |                ^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: `Id::<T>::take` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `id1`

   |                 ^^^^
help: you can `clone` the value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior
   |
12 |     let id2 = id1.clone().take();
