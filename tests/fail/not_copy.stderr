error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `id1`
  --> tests/fail/not_copy.rs:11:5
   |
8  |     let id1: Id<TestStruct> = "oops".into();
   |         --- move occurs because `id1` has type `Id<TestStruct>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
9  |     let id2 = id1;
   |               --- value moved here
10 |
11 |     assert_eq!(id1, id2);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
9  |     let id2 = id1.clone();
